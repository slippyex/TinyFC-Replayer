Tiny Future Composer Library
===

This library is a tiny implementation of the well known __Future Composer__ replayer from __Amiga__. 

It has been originally coded back in 1997 by  [Michael Schwendt - author of the well-known SidPlay](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmms-fc/ "xmms-fc")… as this version has been available for the Unix/Linux as an XMMS-plugin only, I decided to make a static lib with its own DirectX-based replayer out of it. 

###And here we go !!!
My sample exe (with static lib) compiles and [kkrunchy’s](http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/kkrunchy/) down to around __10kb__ … Actually I think it’s quite a good ratio 

The package here contains samples for usage from within 

* C/C++
* FreeBasic 
* PureBasic.

As it contains a DLL-version as well there’s nearly no limit from which programming language you may call it …<br/>
Feel free to download the lib and use it … (credits would be nice …)
